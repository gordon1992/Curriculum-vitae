\section*{Personal Profile}
I am a cheerful and outgoing person who is a good communicator. I am a quick 
learner and have good practical and problem-solving skills along with a 
positive attitude. I am willing to help to the best of my abilities.

I am a student with a keen interest in the IT sector, looking for an 
internship placement to aid my future career prospects and to supplement my 
education.

While studying for my second year University examinations I setup and 
maintained a Wiki on my personal virtual private server to aid the studying 
of my peers as well as my own. This will continue into third year.

My programming projects are available for viewing on GitHub by going to

\section*{Education and Qualifications}
\subsection*{September 2010 to present}
I am a matriculated student at the University of Glasgow where I am studying 
Computing Science. I have completed my second year. My exam results average 
to an A grade and for that I was awarded the Level 2 Class Prize for 
2011-2012.

Outwith University I am currently enrolled in several online courses on the 
Coursera website (www.coursera.org). These are fun and challenging courses to 
gain extra knowledge in IT sectors I have an interest in. I also partake in 
courses on Lynda (www.lynda.com) to improve web design knowledge and other 
learn how to use other computer applications such as Blender.
\section*{Work Experience (most recent first)}
\subsection*{August 2011 to Present}
\subsubsection*{Back-Of-House Specialist for Apple Retail at Braehead 
Shopping Centre}
My duties included maintaining correctness between physical and systematic 
inventory quantities, servicing the shop floor with customer purchases and 
processing deliveries and returns. I worked in a small team with a regular 
solo shift where communication was key. This led to me improving my time 
keeping and work load management skills. In addition to this I organised 
one-day training days for employees working in other parts of the store to 
work with us and learn about our day to day operations. Being able to not 
only do the job but impart knowledge on other individuals was a great 
experience and also improved my knowledge of other parts of the store.

\subsubsection*{Bar Associate for J.D. Wetherspoons at The Sanderling, 
Glasgow Airport}
My duties included serving behind the bar, keeping the bar area clean and
