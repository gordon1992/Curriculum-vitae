\section*{Personal Profile}

I am a cheerful and outgoing person who is a good communicator. I am a quick 
learner and have good practical and problem-solving skills along with a 
positive attitude. I am willing to help to the best of my abilities.

I am a student with a keen interest in the IT sector. My primary areas of
interest are Web Development and Analytics, Steganography, and Cryptography.

My desire is to intern with a firm that falls under the aforementioned
categories. I aim to learn and experience everything I can about these
career paths, including the nature of the work, education and training
involved, and future job outlook. With the rapid development of both the Web
and Security, I am particularly interested in how I can combine these
interests as both areas are becoming increasingly important to all users of
the Web.

\section*{Education and Qualifications}

\subsection*{September 2010 to present}

I am a matriculated student studying Computing Science at the University of 
Glasgow, the institution is a member of Universitas 21 and the Russell Group.
I am currently in my third year where I am heading for a first class degree. 
My exam results average to an A grade and for that I was awarded the Level 2
Class Prize for 2011-2012.

The Computing Science course at the University of Glasgow is accredited by the
British Computer Society (BCS) of which I am a student member (ID: 990354095).

Outwith University I am researching my own personal areas of interest, the
Web and Security. I maintain my own website and server hosted in the
Netherlands where I have self-taught experience in a number of the latest Web
technologies and Debian server management. For Cryptography and Steganography
I am currently reading a number of pieces of literature discussing the past
developments and current status of those security fields.

\section*{Work Experience}

\subsection*{August 2011 to Present}

\subsubsection*{Back-Of-House Specialist for Apple Retail at Braehead 
Shopping Centre}

My work included maintaining correctness between physical and systematic 
inventory quantities, servicing the shop floor with customer purchases, and 
processing deliveries and returns. I worked in a small team with a regular 
solo shift where communication was key. This led to me improving my time 
keeping and work load management skills.

In addition to this I organised one-day training days for employees working in 
other parts of the store to work with us and learn about our day to day 
operations. Being able to not only do the job but impart knowledge on other 
individuals was a great experience and also improved my knowledge of other 
parts of the store.

\section*{Skills}

\subsection*{Languages}

I have working experience in a number of programming and scripting languages,
including C, Java, Python, and SQL.

In addition to those, I also have experience in a number of the latest Web
technologies, including CSS, HTML, Javascript, JQuery, JQueryUI, and PHP.

\subsection*{Operating systems}

I have working knowledge of all of Microsoft's desktop operating systems since
XP, and Apple's Mac OS X.

I also use Debian-based Linux distributions (both GUI and CLI) daily. My
experience also extends to maintaining unmanaged virtual private servers
typically used as LAMP servers.

\subsection*{Miscellaneous}

Practical Grade 5 in Piano

Full clean UK driving licence and car owner since March 2010
