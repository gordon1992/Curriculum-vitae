\section*{Personal Profile}

I am a cheerful and outgoing person who is a good communicator. I am a quick
learner and have good practical and problem-solving skills along with a
positive attitude. I am willing to help to the best of my abilities.

I am a student with a keen interest in the IT sector. I am looking into
Heterogeneous computing, specifically GPGPUs with OpenCL.

My desire is to intern with a firm that falls under the aforementioned
categories. I aim to learn and experience everything I can about these
career paths, including the nature of the work, education and training
involved, and future job outlook. With the rapid development of both cloud
computing and Security, I am particularly interested in how I can combine these
interests as both areas are becoming increasingly important.

My current projects are available for viewing on my GitHub account: \url{github.com/gordon1992}

\section*{Work Experience}

\subsection*{June 2013 to September 2013}

\subsubsection*{Summer IT Analyst for Morgan Stanley}

During the thirteen week internship I was given the responsibility of my own
project. I experienced the full software development life cycle from
requirements gathering and analysis through to quality assurance entry and
eventually to production.

I was the sole developer for an internal web application using Google's Web
Toolkit and Sencha's GXT framework. The application was my first experience
of using these frameworks alongside the Spring framework for the application
configuration. I was able to demonstrate my previous Java abilities and that
I can pick up new and exciting frameworks quickly.

During my time at Morgan Stanley I also had the opportunity to begin learning
the functional programming language Scala which complemented my out of office
learning of Haskell.

\subsection*{August 2011 to January 2013}

\subsubsection*{Back-Of-House Specialist for Apple Retail at Braehead
Shopping Centre}

My work included maintaining correctness between physical and systematic
inventory quantities, servicing the shop floor with customer purchases, and
processing deliveries and returns. I worked in a small team with a regular
solo shift where communication was key. This led to me improving my time
keeping and work load management skills.

In addition to this I organised one-day training days for employees working in
other parts of the store to work with us and learn about our day to day
operations. Being able to not only do the job but impart knowledge on other
individuals was a great experience and also improved my knowledge of other
parts of the store.

\section*{Skills}

\subsection*{Languages and Frameworks}

I have working experience in a number of programming and scripting languages,
including C, Java, Python, and SQL. I also have industry experience in using
the Spring, GWT, and GXT frameworks.

In addition to those, I also have experience in a number of the latest Web
technologies, including CSS, HTML, Javascript, JQuery, JQueryUI, and PHP.

\subsection*{Operating systems}

I have working knowledge of all of Microsoft's desktop operating systems since
XP, and Apple's Mac OS X.

I also use Debian-based Linux distributions (both GUI and CLI) daily. My
experience also extends to maintaining unmanaged virtual private servers
typically used as LAMP servers.

\subsection*{Miscellaneous}

Practical Grade 5 in Piano

Full clean UK driving licence and car owner since March 2010
