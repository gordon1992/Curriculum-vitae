\section*{Work Experience (most recent first)}
\subsection*{August 2011 to Present}
\subsubsection*{Back-Of-House Specialist for Apple Retail at Braehead Shopping Centre}
My duties included maintaining correctness between physical and systematic inventory quantities, servicing the shop floor with customer purchases and processing deliveries and returns. I worked in a small team with a regular solo shift where communication was key. This led to me improving my time keeping and work load management skills. In addition to this I organised one-day training days for employees working in other parts of the store to work with us and learn about our day to day operations. Being able to not only do the job but impart knowledge on other individuals was a great experience and also improved my knowledge of other parts of the store.
